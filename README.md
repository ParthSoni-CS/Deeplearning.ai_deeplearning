# Deeplearning.ai_deeplearning

## This is my repository to explain what i've in this 5 courses that are contributed by Andrew Ng 

### First of all I would like to appriciate Andrew Ng and the whole crew of deeplearning.ai to provide such specialization which cover almost everything about deeplearning. 
### Not just that every week in each course are provided with 3-4 hrs of assignments. 1 or 2 such assignments are provided in each week.

#### About the Deep Learning Specialization. [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)
The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology.

In this Specialization, you will build and train neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learn how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. Get ready to master theoretical concepts and their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow and tackle real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more. AI is transforming many industries. The Deep Learning Specialization provides a pathway for you to take the definitive step in the world of AI by helping you gain the knowledge and skills to level up your career. Along the way, you will also get career advice from deep learning experts from industry and academia.

### It took me almost 4 and a half months to complete this course of specialization with graded assignments and quiz.

### This is my [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/H68YR54VUF48) for completion of this specialization 
### Here I will elucidate into detailed explaination about each of the course in this specialization 

## COURSE NO.1 : Neural Networks and Deep Learning. [CERTIFICATE](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/HBBY6ZXNWCV7)
#### Summery: [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)
In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 
By the end, you will be familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.
